The N protein protects the virus RNA, keeping it stable inside the virus. Many N proteins link together in a long spiral, wrapping and coiling the RNA, also called the ‘nucleocapsid membrane’. It is the only protein from the major structural proteins that functions primarily to bind the CoV RNA genome (making the nucleocapsid).
