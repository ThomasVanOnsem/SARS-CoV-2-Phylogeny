This polyprotein is actually a chain of 16 proteins joined together: the non-structural proteins. Two of these proteins act like scissors, snipping the links between the different proteins and freeing them to do their jobs. Some of the research on other coronaviruses has given scientists a good understanding of what some of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins do. But other proteins are far more mysterious, and some might do nothing at all.
