The envelope protein is the smallest major structural protein that is involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. It helps form the oily bubble of the virus and researchers have found that it latches onto proteins that help turn our own geneson and off. It is possible that pattern changes when the E protein interferes. Because of these critical aspects, CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates.
